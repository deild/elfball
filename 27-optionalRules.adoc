= Alternate rules

The following rules are optional rules and teams for Elfball and need to be agreed upon by both you and your opponent OR your league commissioner to be used.

== Timed game
If you would rather play Elfball for a timed game instead of the first to 1, 2 or 3 goals this optional rule should be considered. Take a standard playing card deck and set it beside the board. Each time the player that lost the face-off finishes his team's turn remove one card from the deck. When you run out of cards, the game is finished. The 2-Minute Warning card deck is a great way to do this option with special events that liven up the game (sold separately).

== Double player movement
During each team's turn, two players may be moved instead of just one each team turn unless the first player suffers a Shift in Momentum. You do not choose the second player to be  moved until the first has completed his action. The player marked with the last moved marker is always the player holding the ball at the start of the turn (if he was one of the two players to move) otherwise the first player moved receives the last moved marker. Any Momentum earned by the first player and not used may be added to and used by the second player moving.

== Change to challenge dice results
Challenge dice

The star symbol represents a major success and counts as two successes.

NOTE: This optional rule is HEAVILY recommended for your first few games of Elfball to get used to the rules. When using this rule ignore any comments in the rulebook about conditional successes as the star face now counts as two successes instead of a conditional success.

== The face off
NOTE: This optional rule is HEAVILY recommended for your first few games of Elfball to get used to the rules. Replace this entire section for the Face-Off up to Turn
Sequence with:

Play for a Test beings with a face-off between the two players set up on the centre circle. Each Team Manager rolls 6 challenge dice for Face-off. The player with the highest number of successes (including zero if your opponent flopped) has won the face-off. In the event of a tie, roll another face-off. Continue rolling tie-break face-offs until either one player wins or both players flop. A player who flops a face-off challenge has tripped and is placed Down on the field. If both players flop the face-off, a new face-off is started with the same starting setup for each team. If the player who wins the face-off has a Might higher than his Skill, he must move up to two hexes inside the Face-off circle and automatically succeed in tackling his opponent resulting in his opponent becoming Down (roll no dice for Impact, Tackle, or Grit challenges). If his Skill is higher than his Might he automatically gains possession of the elfball (place the elfball token on his base to indicate that he has the ball). If the winning player's Might and Skill attributes are equal, then he may choose which of these two events occurs. After the Face-Off, the team of the winner of the face-off goes first to take his normal turn. Any player (including the face-off winner) is eligible to be moved as part of this first action.

== SAMHAINO HORROR
Instead of fielding a Deadwood, a Samhaino team may field a Samhaino Horror. These creatures of pure nightmare are extremely difficult to get away from due to the long tentacles that cover their body. A Samhaino Horror has the following attributes:
Jog 4 / Might 4 / Tackle 5 / Dodge 1 / Skill 1 / Grit 6 Type: Defender

== Impcrusher
The Thunder Hammer Dwarf team can field the dreaded Impcrusher. In addition as an alternate rule, the Gnome team can field an Impcrusher instead of a Gnomish  Contraption as part of their team. The Impcrusher exists solely to run down opponents on the field â€¦ especially ones already on the ground. Referees usually hate the Impcrusher so after each turn where the Impcrusher was the player taking the action, roll a Challenge dice. On a Flop, the Referee has decided to ban the Impcrusher from the field. Remove the Impcrusher from the field and it may not be fielder for the rest of the game. The Impcrusher if it is part of the team may not gain experience points, may not learn new abilities, and may not use magic potions. The Impcrusher has the ability Cheapshot, Ruthless, Pummel and Plough

== Hired Gun Wizard (20 points each, only 1 allowed)
Your team may contact the local Wizard's Guild and petition to hire a Wizard for your team. The wizard the Guild allows you to hire are often the novices and they only have enough endurance to cast one spell per a match. The Hired Gun Wizard never sets a foot on the playing field, has a Skill attribute of 5, and can be called upon to cast one of three spells: System Shock, Inferno, or Transmutation (coach's choice). Use of a Wizard is done instead of taking an action with a player for this turn. A Wizard can earn and use Momentum.
System Shock: Every neuron in a single opponent's body fires at the same time if this spell is successful. Elfballs however help "ground" a player to resist this spell. The Wizard makes a System Shock challenge when casting this spell.
Inferno: A section of the playing field erupts into a towering pillar of flame. The spell target one hex and all 6 hexes adjacent to that hex.. Any player (from either team) who is in one of these hexes must roll an Inferno challenge to try and avoid the effects of the flames.
