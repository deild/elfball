*NAINS MARTEAU TONNERRE*

_The Dwarves living deep under the mountains of the Middle Kingdoms come in two clans. The western based Thunder Hammer clan use no magic and live their lives as a united group dedicated to hard work, strong ale and gold (lots and lots of gold.) They have great relationships with the neighbouring Gnomes and often commission them to construct a terrifying device called the Impcrusher to assist their game._
