== Objective of the game
A match is made up of a series of Tests. The winner of each Test is the first team to score a goal which ends the Test. A match continues until one team has won a pre-determined number of Tests. A normal game would be played to first goal wins, but Advanced rules games should usually be played to two or three goals to win - make sure you and your opponent agree on this before starting the game. To score a goal, a player holding the ball must end his action in the opponent's goal circle hex.

NOTE: Your first few games of Elfball to better learn the rules and increase game speed really should be played to one goal with the Optional rules to change the Star result on the Challenge dice and the Face-Off.
