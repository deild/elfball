== Player attributes
Every player of Elfball has seven attributes which define his performance on the field. These are:

*Jog* : This is the maximum number of paces (hexes) which a player is able to move/act during one turn.

*Tackle* : This represents the player's ability to attempt to bring down (i.e. tackle) opponents and prevent opponents from getting away from him.

*Might* : This attribute is a player's brute force and controls the power he can hit with and strength needed to bring him down.

*Dodge* This controls how well a player can disengage from an opponent and defend against tackles.

*Skill* This attribute represents a player's ability to throw, catch, and pick up the ball.

*Grit* This is the player's toughness and his ability to stay in the game and withstand punishment.

*Type* This defines the basic category of the player and determines which skills he can learn as part of the advanced rules for the game.
